# fractions
#### Overview
An illuminating example of **C++** class coding which contains an implementation of the *Rational Numbers* class, partially overlapping with the STL class ``std::ratio``. This class contains:
* safe constructors
* safe access/edit methods
* internal operators overload
* external (abelian) operators overload
* simple random fraction generators

The class definition is contained in ``fractions_class.hpp``, along with its implementation, in compliance with the **Boost lib** *include-and-compile* philosophy.

#### Installation
This repo comes with a ``makefile``...so just ``make`` it!
